👋 Hi! I’m Farhad Babakhil, a passionate Web Developer with expertise in ASP.NET Core, C#, and SQL Server.

I specialize in building secure, scalable APIs and full-stack web applications designed to solve real-world business challenges. With hands-on experience in developing systems like reception management, tenant tracking, property dealer platforms, and inventory control, I focus on delivering clean, maintainable code using best practices like Clean Architecture and layered design.

My technical toolkit includes:

Backend: ASP.NET Core, C#, Entity Framework Core, Dapper, LINQ

Databases: SQL Server, stored procedures, query optimization

APIs: RESTful services, JWT authentication, caching, pagination

Frontend collaboration: CSS, HTML, Angular, and JavaScript (working closely with frontend teams)

I’m always eager to learn and improve, staying updated with the latest tech trends to build performant and reliable solutions.
